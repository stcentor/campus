Contributing

Follow this guide loosely for now until I write this up for our specific case https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests

Basically on your own fork you will:

create new branch
do work
commit work
push it to origin which is your fork still
make a Pull Request (PR) to this repo from your repo on github
I will review the change and either add it or comment what needs to be fixed
